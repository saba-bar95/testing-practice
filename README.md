## Jest testing

This project uses Jest for unit testing. The tests are located in the **\*_/_.test.js** file, and the units in functions directory.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```
$ npm run test
```

Or, to run the tests in watch mode:

```
$ npm run watch
```

This will automatically re-run the tests whenever you make changes to the code.
